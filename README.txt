                  Overview
---------------------------------------------------
A website showcasing a relational database.
The idea would be that the amount of HQ's of surveillance companies in a country 
could be crossed with the freedom score. This might show that more surveillance 
companies would be located in more free countries. With only 528 companies in 
45 countries this might prove to not show anything, but let's hope it does.

Freedom in the world data provided by Freedom House

Companies data is the surveillance industry index

city-to-country data provided by https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities

to convert to SQL I used https://sqlizer.io/, this made it way easier to compile 
into SQL. As the data is not sensitive this should not lead to any concerns.
